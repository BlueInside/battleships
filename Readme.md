## Introduction

The Battleship Game project is a web-based implementation of the classic Battleship board game. The main goal of this project was to learn and practice Test-Driven Development (TDD) using Jest, a popular JavaScript testing framework, and to gain experience with essential web development technologies.

## Features

### Test-Driven Development (TDD):

This project emphasizes the practice of writing tests before implementing features, ensuring code reliability and maintainability.

### Webpack:

Webpack is used for bundling and managing project assets, making it easier to organize and optimize the code.

### Babel Transpiler:

Babel is utilized to transpile modern JavaScript code into a compatible version that can run in various browsers.

### ESLint:

ESLint is configured to maintain code quality and enforce coding standards, helping ensure consistency across the project.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- Jest
- Webpack
- Babel
- ESLint
- HTML
- CSS

## Usage

Gameplay: Follow the on-screen instructions to play Battleship. Your mission is to sink your opponent's fleet of ships before they sink yours.

Setup: Place your ships on the game board by clicking and dragging them. Rotate the ships using the provided button.

Starting the Game: Click the "Play" button to start the game once you've positioned your ships.
